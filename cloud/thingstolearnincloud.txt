Simply using ELB/ALB you won’t be able to distribute traffic between two regions. But combine it with Route 53 and you will be able to do so. Your solution will leverage Route53’s routing policy (Weighted ) to direct your request to load balancers created in different regions. Those load balancers will distribute traffic to the listeners registered to them in different AZs.
