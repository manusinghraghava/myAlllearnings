bit bucket and git  

git is a distributed repository-->local as well remote

git has .git(hidden) folder which has index file which maintains staging of files..

git add=>if we add new file in repository..git is not able to track it or auto-stage..than we right click on file and just select add..to mak it staged(version from non-version)

we can  also select (check for modification file) to see it is staged or not.

if we modified existing file it automatic show in staged while comitting ..

fetch==> bring changes of remote branch into remote tracking branch(middle layer)(mainly when we create new branch and wanna checkout)

merge==>merge the changes of tracking branch into local branch..

pull==> pull changes of remote branch into remote tracking branch.


Merging branches==>

fast forward merge==>when we merge child branch into parent
steps-->
a)first checkout into the parent branch..
b)than go to tortoise git merge==>than select the child branch in merge select box from branch..


stashing==>saving uncommitted changes==>
lets take a example we are working on some files and we have to checkout on different branch..
we have two options either committ the changes or undo the our code...
if neither stash come into the picture it just saves our changes into temporary folder..
stash save==>save changes
stash pop==>undo

revert==> if you have done some changes in local directory and you want to go back on last pull..
just go on tortoise->revert and select the file in which you want to take revert..remember through this we can only revert file which are staged..or versioned or tracked


or if you want to clean your repository to last commit fully
go to log-->right click the last committ--> reset-->in reset checked hard..
                       0r
we can use tortoise git-->clean up command..
                       Or
go to log-->right click the last committ--> reset-->revert..

staging area----files which go in next committ

cherry pick==>it is like merge but merge merges all the commit in a branch..if we want to merge only a basic committ we will use the cherry pick..

squash==>if we want to make a commit on a base of all commit we will use squash while merging

rebase==>it is like merge but it will create new commit in the branch of second branch on you will do rebase...

some popular git commands...

git config --global user.name//email "--"  //to register user

git init-------to make a folder into a git repository

git add --a -------putting all file of folder in staging area. only these file get commiited

git status ----------------to check new changes we have done in repository

git commit -m "message" ----------comiiting code

git log --------show all commiitt

rm -rf .git---------remove tracking of repository and delete .git folder

git clone url nameOfFOlder --------------------cloning 

touch .gitignore   ------------------creating git ignore file

git diff ------compare working directory and staging area(ready for comitt)

git diff --staged   ------compare staging area(ready for comitt) and last commit

git commit -a -m "message" ----------comiiting code directly without using add

git checkout -b "branchName" ---------------switch to branch if not present it will create it.

git branch ----------show all child branch.

git remote add origin "url of git repository"-------------to add local repository on github

git push -u origin master--------pushing all local files on local repository to github.


Git reset commitid------>to make change reset till this committ..

 git push --no-verify --set-upstream origin branch name    and git fetch origin branchName
...........when we losse track.

git reset --hard   -----------to remove all changes..

git clean -df    ------------to remove all untracked file.

concurrent hashmap==>
It is thread Safe.alternative of Hashtable
when we synchronized it..it only synchronize certain portion of map thats why dont throw concurrent modification exception
null keys are not allowed..
ConcurrentHashMap is best suited when you have multiple readers and few writers. If writers outnumber reader,
 or writer is equal to reader, than performance of ConcurrentHashMap effectively reduces to synchronized map or Hashtable. 
Performance of CHM drops, because you got to lock all portion of Map, and effectively each reader will wait for another writer, operating on that portion of Map. 

ConcurrentHashMap by default is separated into 16 regions and locks are applied. This default number can be set while initializing a ConcurrentHashMap instance.

ConcurrentHashMap m = new ConcurrentHashMap(); 
        m.put(100, "Hello"); 
        m.put(101, "Geeks"); 
        m.put(102, "Geeks"); 
  
        // Here we cant add Hello because 101 key 
        // is already present in ConcurrentHashMap object 
        m.putIfAbsent(101, "Hello"); 
  
        // We can remove entry because 101 key 
        // is associated with For value 
        m.remove(101, "Geeks"); 
  
        // Now we can add Hello 
        m.putIfAbsent(103, "Hello"); 
  
        // We cant replace Hello with For 
        m.replace(101, "Hello", "For"); 
        System.out.println(m); 
    } 
} 
ConcurrentHashMap is introduced as an alternative of Hashtable and provided all functions supported by Hashtable with an additional feature called "concurrency level", 
which allows ConcurrentHashMap to partition Map. ConcurrentHashMap allows multiple readers to read concurrently without any blocking. 
This is achieved by partitioning Map into different parts based on concurrency level and locking only a portion of Map during updates. 
Default concurrency level is 16, and accordingly Map is divided into 16 part and each part is governed with a different lock. 
This means, 16 thread can operate on Map simultaneously(at same time) until they are operating on different part of Map. 
This makes ConcurrentHashMap high performance despite keeping thread-safety intact.  
Though, it comes with a caveat. Since update operations like put(), remove(), putAll() or clear() is not synchronized, concurrent retrieval may not reflect most recent change on Map.

synchronized(map){
  if (map.get(key) == null){
      return map.put(key, value);
  } else{
      return map.get(key);
  }
}

Though this code will work fine in HashMap and Hashtable, This won't work in ConcurrentHashMap; because, during put operation whole map is not locked, 
and while one thread is putting value, other thread's get() call can still return null which result in one thread overriding value inserted by other thread. 
Ofcourse, you can wrap whole code in synchronized block and make it thread-safe but that will only make your code single threaded. 
ConcurrentHashMap provides putIfAbsent(key, value) which does same thing but atomically and thus eliminates above race condition.

Enum=>
It is used for constants..
Enum Mobile
{
A,B,C //These all are constants
}
Internally-->

Class Mobile
{
static final Mobile A = new Mobile();    //Actually all these are object of that class
static final Mobile B = new Mobile();    //which is static and file
static final Mobile C = new Mobile();    //whise toString() return the name of referrence
}

As these are object than it also can have constuctor//

public enum Level {
    HIGH  (3),  //calls constructor with value 3
    MEDIUM(2),  //calls constructor with value 2
    LOW   (1)   //calls constructor with value 1
    ; // semicolon needed when fields / methods follow


    private final int levelCode;

    private Level(int levelCode) {
        this.levelCode = levelCode;
    }
 public int getLevelCode() {
        return this.levelCode;
    }
}
//
System.out.println(level.getLevelCode()); ///////when we call object it will call constructor and print that value

difference between spring:url and c:url

<spring:url value="/something" var="url" htmlEscape="true"/>
 <a href="${url}">...</a>

But you an also use c:url

 <c:url value="/something" var="url"/>
 <a href="<c:out value='${url}'/>">...</a>//no need for out in spring

The one important difference between c:url and spring:url is, 
that c:url does not html encode the created url. 
But for a valid url the & between the url parameters must be a &amp;. So you need the c:out to escape it. 
-- In spring:url you have this functionality already included (if I understand the documentation correct).

Marshalling===>In computer science, marshalling or marshaling is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission, 
and it is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another.

Marshalling: Converting Objects to XML
In this example, we need to convert Java objects to an XML document. First, we need to create a POJO class.

import javax.xml.bind.annotation.*;
@XmlRootElement
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int id;
    private String subject;
    Student(){
    }
    Student(String name,int id,String subject){
        this.name=name;
        this.id=id;
        this.subject=subject;
    }
    @XmlElement
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    @XmlAttribute
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    @XmlElement
    public String getSubject() {
        return subject;
    }
    public void setSubject(String subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
    }
}


In the above class:

@XmlRootElement specifies the root element for the XML document.

@XmlAttribute specifies the attribute for the root element.

@XmlElement specifies the sub-element for the root element.

Now, we will call the marshaller method

try{
    //creating the JAXB context
    JAXBContext jContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);
    //creating the marshaller object
    Marshaller marshallObj = jContext.createMarshaller();
    //setting the property to show xml format output
    marshallObj.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
    //setting the values in POJO class
    Student student = new Student(“abhishek”, 1163, “hadoop”);
    //calling the marshall method
    marshallObj.marshal(student, new FileOutputStream(“/home/knoldus/Desktop/student.xml”));
} catch(Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


Unmarshalling: Converting XML to Objects
try{
    //getting the xml file to read
    File file = new File(“/home/knoldus/Desktop/student.xml”);
    //creating the JAXB context
    JAXBContext jContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Student.class);
    //creating the unmarshall object
    Unmarshaller unmarshallerObj = jContext.createUnmarshaller();
    //calling the unmarshall method
    Student student=(Student) unmarshallerObj.unmarshal(file);
    System.out.println(student.getName()+” “+student.getId()+” “+student.getSubject());
}catch(Exception e){
    e.printStackTrace();
}


MEDIA_TYPE – Determine the produced output media type (JSON, XML).
JSON_INCLUDE_ROOT – Flag to determine whether you want to include the JSON root element in the produced output or not.
JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT – Flag to determine whether you want to format the produced output or not.

// Create a JaxBContext
package com.jcg.jaxb.json;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext;
import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;
import javax.xml.bind.Marshaller;

import org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.MarshallerProperties;

/**
 * @author ashraf_sarhan
 * 
 */
public class MarshallerDemo {

	/**
	 * @param args
	 * @throws JAXBException
	 * Marshaller POJO to JSON using EclipseLink MOXy
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) throws JAXBException {

		// Creating a new employee pojo object with data
		Employee employee = new Employee();
		employee.setId(1);
		employee.setName("Ashraf");
		List skills = new ArrayList();
		skills.add("java");
		skills.add("sql");
		employee.setSkills(skills);

		// Create a JaxBContext
		JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(Employee.class);

		// Create the Marshaller Object using the JaxB Context
		Marshaller marshaller = jc.createMarshaller();
		
		// Set the Marshaller media type to JSON or XML
		marshaller.setProperty(MarshallerProperties.MEDIA_TYPE,
				"application/json");
		
		// Set it to true if you need to include the JSON root element in the JSON output
		marshaller.setProperty(MarshallerProperties.JSON_INCLUDE_ROOT, true);
		
		// Set it to true if you need the JSON output to formatted
		marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);
		
		// Marshal the employee object to JSON and print the output to console
		marshaller.marshal(employee, System.out);
	}

}
Output:

1
{

   "employee" : {
      "id" : 1,
      "name" : "Ashraf",
      "skills" : [ "java", "sql" ]
   }
}
4. Unmarshal JSON to Java Object:
Create a JaxBContext using the Employee class then read the provided JSON string and convert it back to the “employee” Java object using Unmarshaller object with following two properties:

MEDIA_TYPE – Determine the provided input media type (JSON, XML).
JSON_INCLUDE_ROOT – Flag to determine whether you want to include the JSON root element in the provided input or not.
UnmarshallerDemo.java:

package com.jcg.jaxb.json;

import java.io.StringReader;

import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext;
import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;
import javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller;
import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
import org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.UnmarshallerProperties;

/**
 * @author ashraf_sarhan
 * 
 */
public class UnmarshallerDemo {

	/**
	 * @param args
	 * @throws JAXBException
	 *             Unmarshaller JSON to POJO using EclipseLink MOXy
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) throws JAXBException {

		// Create a JaxBContext
		JAXBContext jc = JAXBContext.newInstance(Employee.class);

		// Create the Unmarshaller Object using the JaxB Context
		Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jc.createUnmarshaller();

		// Set the Unmarshaller media type to JSON or XML
		unmarshaller.setProperty(UnmarshallerProperties.MEDIA_TYPE,
				"application/json");

		// Set it to true if you need to include the JSON root element in the
		// JSON input
		unmarshaller
				.setProperty(UnmarshallerProperties.JSON_INCLUDE_ROOT, true);

		// Create the StreamSource by creating StringReader using the JSON input
		StreamSource json = new StreamSource(
				new StringReader(
						"{\"employee\":{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Ashraf\",\"skills\":[\"java\",\"sql\"]}}"));

		// Getting the employee pojo again from the json
		Employee employee = unmarshaller.unmarshal(json, Employee.class)
				.getValue();

		// Print the employee data to console
		System.out.println("Employee Id: " + employee.getId());
		System.out.println("\nEmployee Name: " + employee.getName());
		System.out.println("\nEmployee Skills: "
				+ StringUtils.join(employee.getSkills(), ','));
	}

}
Output:

{

   "employee" : {

      "id" : 1,

      "name" : "Ashraf",

      "skills" : [ "java", "sql" ]

   }

}

Specify MOXy as the JAXB Provider (jaxb.properties)
To configure MOXy as your JAXB provider simply add a file named jaxb.properties in the same package as your domain model with the following entry:

===========================================================================================================================================================================================


Reflexion==>Through this we can call the private method of a class outside the class==>

How==>
class A

{

private void method show()
{
Syso("Helloo")
}
In Another Class==>
Class c = Class.ForName("Full path of class with package name");
A a =(A)c.newInstance();

Method m =c.getDeclaredMethod("para1","para2");
para1==>name of method
para2==>parametres in method

m.setAccessible(true);   ///making public to this class

m.invoke("para1","para2");

para1==>object of class
para2==>parametres in method



============================================================================================================================
MultiValueMap in Java==>
Java has a useful built in collection library. ... One of this collection is the MultiValueMap. 
This collection is a map with a key and value, but the value is a collection instead of one single value.

In some cases, you would like to define a map that holds a collection of values against each key (one to many relationship). 
You can not use HashMap for this task. Instead, you will use the MultiValueMap. 
The MultiValueMap class did not come with the Java standard collections API. It is in Apache's Commons Collections API.

Syntax==>MultiMap<String, String> mmap=new MultiValueMap<String, String>();

It returns Collection of values==>Collection values=(Collection) mmap.get(key);


================================================================================================================================

FlatMap==>

Obviously this is a lot of rework and we have to manually merge the lists to get a single list of elements and then apply map() function. 
This is where flatMap() is very useful. Let’s see how we can use flatMap() to perform the same operation.



List<String> betterLetters = Stream.of(l1, l2)
				.flatMap(List::stream)
				.map(String::toUpperCase)
				.collect(Collectors.toList());

Now it’s clear that we used flatMap() function to flatten the Stream of Lists to Stream of elements.

@Test
public void testflatMap() throws Exception {
    List<Integer> together = Stream.of(asList(1, 2), asList(3, 4)) // Stream of List<Integer>
            .flatMap(List::stream)                                 // Converting into singleStream...
            .map(integer -> integer + 1)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    assertEquals(asList(2, 3, 4, 5), together);
}



=======================================================================================================================================

Calling javaScript from java==>

for this we need javascript engine which is introduced in java 1.8. known as Java Nashorn.

Nashorn is a JavaScript engine. It is used to execute JavaScript code dynamically at JVM (Java Virtual Machine). 
Java provides a command-line tool jjs which is used to execute JavaScript code.

You can execute JavaScript code by using jjs command-line tool and by embedding into Java source code.

You can execute JavaScript file directly from your Java file. In the following code, we are reading a file hello.js with the help of FileReader class.

Example==>

import javax.script.*;  
import java.io.*;  
public class NashornExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{  
        // Creating script engine  
        ScriptEngine ee = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("Nashorn");  
        // Reading Nashorn file  
        ee.eval(new FileReader("js/hello.js"));  
    }  
}  


Example: Setting JavaScript variable in Java File

import javax.script.*;  
import java.io.*;  
public class NashornExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{  
        // Creating script engine  
        ScriptEngine ee = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("Nashorn");  
        //Binding script and Define scope of script  
        Bindings bind = ee.getBindings(ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE);  
        bind.put("name", "Nashorn");                                     //putting value 
        // Reading Nashorn file  
        ee.eval(new FileReader("js/hello.js"));  
    }  
}  



Calling JavaScript function inside Java code==>

You can call JavaScript function inside the Java file. In the followed example, we are calling JavaScript functions.

Example: Calling function inside Java code



File: hello.js

var functionDemo1 = function(){  
    print("This is JavaScript function");  
}  
var functionDemo2 = function(message){  
    print("Hello "+message);  
} 



 
File: NashornExample.java

import javax.script.*;  
import java.io.*;  
public class NashornExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{  
        // Creating script engine  
        ScriptEngine ee = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("Nashorn");  
        // Reading Nashorn file  
        ee.eval(new FileReader("js/hello.js"));  
        Invocable invocable = (Invocable)ee;  
        // calling a function  
        invocable.invokeFunction("functionDemo1");  
        // calling a function and passing variable as well.  
        invocable.invokeFunction("functionDemo2","Nashorn");       
    }  
}  



==================================================================================================================================================================

Gson==>GSON is Google's JSON parser and generator for Java. 
Creating a Gson Instance
Before you can use GSON you must first create a new Gson object. There are two ways to create a Gson instance:

Using new Gson()===>Gson gson = new Gson();
Creating a GsonBuilder instance and calling create() on it.==>new GsonBuilder().create();

Parsing JSON Into Java Objects
new Gson().fromJson(json, Car.class);

The Gson instance creates an instance of this class and parses the JSON into it. 
Thus you should make sure that this class has a no-arg constructor, or GSON cannot use it.

Here is how the Car class looks:

public class Car {
    public String brand = null;
    public int    doors = 0;
}


Generating JSON From Java Objects
GSON can also generate JSON from Java objects. You do so via the Gson object.
 To generate JSON you call the toJson() method of the Gson object. Here is an example of generating JSON from a Java object with GSON:

Car car = new Car();
car.brand = "Rover";
car.doors = 5;

Gson gson = new Gson();

String json = gson.toJson(car);

output
{"brand":"Rover","doors":5}

However, this compact JSON can be hard to read. 
Therefore GSON offers a pretty printing option where the JSON is printed so it is more readable in a text editor. 
Here is an example of how to create a Gson instance with pretty print enabled:

Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
Here is an example of how the same JSON would look pretty printed:

{
  "brand": "Rover",
  "doors": 5
}

Excluding Fields
1)Transient Fields
If you make a field in a Java class transient then GSON will ignore it in both serialization and deserialization. 
Here is how the Car class from earlier looks with the brand field marked as transient:

public class Car {
    public transient String brand = null;
    public int    doors = 0;
}

                                                    ////////////or//////////////
													
													The @Expose Annotation
The GSON @Expose annotation (com.google.gson.annotations.Expose) can be used to mark a field to be exposed or not (included or not) when an object is serialized 
or deserialized. The @Expose annotation can take two parameters.
 Each parameter is a boolean which can take either the value true or false. Here are some GSON @Expose annotation examples to show what I mean:

@Expose(serialize = true);
@Expose(serialize = false);
@Expose(deserialize = true);
@Expose(deserialize = false);
@Expose(serialize = true , deserialize = false);
@Expose(serialize = false, deserialize = true);

Notice the @Expose annotation above the fields, telling whether the given field should be included when serialized or deserialized.

In order to get GSON to react to the @Expose annotations you must create a Gson instance using the GsonBuilder class. Here is how that looks:

GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();
builder.excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation();
Gson gson = builder.create();

**)GsonBuilder.setExclusionStrategies()
Another way to exclude a field of a class from serialization or deserialization in GSON is to set an ExclusionStrategy on a GsonBuilder, 
and use that GsonBuilder to build the Gson object with.

ExclusionStrategy is an interface, so you will have to create a class that implements the ExclusionStrategy interface. 
Here is an example that implements the ExclusionStrategy interface with an anonymous class:

ExclusionStrategy exclusionStrategy = new ExclusionStrategy() {
    public boolean shouldSkipField(FieldAttributes fieldAttributes) {
        if("brand".equals(fieldAttributes.getName())){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean shouldSkipClass(Class aClass) {
        return false;
    }
};
Notice that inside the shouldSkipField() method of the ExclusionStrategy implementation the example checks if the given field name is brand. If it is, 
that field is excluded from serialization and deserialization.

**)Serializing Null Fields
By default the Gson object does not serialize fields with null values to JSON. If a field in a Java object is null, Gson excludes it.

You can force Gson to serialize null values via the GsonBuilder. Here is an example showing how to force serialization of null values with GSON:

GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();

builder.serializeNulls();

Gson gson = builder.create();

Car car = new Car();
car.brand = null;

String json = gson.toJson(car);
System.out.println(json);
