Scrum==>Scrum is a framework which support complex product development.
why framework?
Methodolgy==>it is a set of methods for a particular activity.
framework==>It is a basic structure for development with some guidlines..

Scrum principle==>
a)transparency==>to believe in each other
b)inspection==>it is important to have feedback at every point helps in improvement..
c)adaptation==>combination of both to work on same goal..with callobration
d)time boxing==>ensures certain time limits for certain events..

Scrum Master==>coach for scrum practices.
a)Enabling communication across for all roles==>work as mediator

Scrum Product Owner==>maintains  product backlog==>certain work items example..enhancements 
a)represents voice of customer
b)defined acceptance criteria for qa.
c)to determine release dates and concepts

Scrum development teams exclude SM and PO and share same goal to fullfillment of sprint
and chooses what work to do.and have different skillsets

Scrum sprint planning meeting==>8 hours meeting staring for a sprint.
a)team understands what to have done in sprint and requirement.
b)starts with order product backlog.. In the simplest definition the Scrum Product Backlog is simply a list of all things that needs to be done within the project. 

daily scrum==>15 minutes==>each member tell==>what i have accomplished,and what i plan for future,and should place on same place daily(update).

sprint review meeting==>4 hours meeting
a)at the end of sprint for review of output ..result==>revised product backlog..
b)point of discussion product increment===>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint.

sprint retrospective meeting==>for development what they have developed and what they can improve
a)3 hours meeting
b)what went well and what gone wrong...regarding tools are they good or not.

product backlog grooming meeting==>happens between sprint
a)what is coming in next sprint.
b)not all scrum members required.
c)team reviews and provide input to PO..mostly happens between SM and PO.

product backlog contains everything...as minor as story as big as design change...feature request and as bug fixing..


Scrum tools==>jira etc..
==============================================================================================
Agile==>it is a software development methodology used to built software incrementally..
