Statistics-->
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied

three steps-->
a)collecting of data.
b)analysis of data.
c)result on analysis(interpretation)//////all three is statics. and it is used for prediction,decision

maily two types-->
a)discriptive----> summerizing,analyzing and visualizing the data
             ---->mean,median,mode(measure of central  tendency)
			 ---->measure of dispersion , variance, standard deviation
			 ---->corelation,covariance etc.
			 ---->histogram,pdf(probability density function),pmf(probability mass function),cdf(cummulative density),etc etc
             ----> univarant , bivariant , kernel density 
             ---->what is the common age of students in classroom(mean)

b)inferential--->using data for a conclusion for whole state which is known as population(state)
hypothesi testing , null and alernate hypothesis
z-test
t-test
is the common age of students is same u expected of as university.

Population(N) : --->the group that we are interested in studying.

Sample(n):----> A subset of population which represent whole population

example-->lets take example of exit poll
we cannot descide by asking every person.
so we will ask some random people across every region (sample)
by all sample we will decide who can be winner (population)

different type of sampling techniques-->
a)simple random sampling-->select random sample from population
while doibg random sampling every member of population has a chance of equal selection.

b)stratified sampling-->sampling of different groups but it should not be overlapped.
example--> like exit poll first we divide in men and women...which can be further divide in young and old.

c)systematic sampling--->like we are selected nth sample every time to visualize..

d)convenience sampling(voluentary response)--> sample create from expertise persons.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
variable-->
quantitive and qualitative (categorical)

in quantitive we have discrete and continous
discrete(whole number)---> number of students
continous(infinite)------> height   ///////any thing can be go inside

in qualitative--->we can define in categories like gender than we can go onmale and female
it is type of classification based on properties.

central tendency---> used to find centre of distribution of data.
technique used-->
mean(M)   average 
median    middle element
mode      most frequent  


now take example which we have to use where in case of data set
when we dont have much outliors(huge difference in data) we will go for mean (average)
if we have huge outliors we will go for median...for median first we sort the data and find middle element.
if it is odd middle is easy otherwise in case of odd take average of both middle element.

if we have not som much different data and have repeated values we can use mode to fill na
