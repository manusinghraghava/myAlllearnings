Payment Integration using spring Boot-->

how payment works?

1)when customer click on payment on web/page.
2)payment will initiate and go to server/side first(java end).
3)java end will use razor pay api to create a order on razor pay api.
4)razor pay will create an order for payment and return an ordder_id..
5)we will save order information in db with user details.
6)now we will send back order_id and amount to web/page where it shows amount to be paid and order-id associated with it.
7)now we will submit checkout form with order_id which will hit razor pay server directly because we have already created order for it.
8)on success/failure razor will return payment_id,order_id,razorpay_signature.
9)change paid status on java server.
